# frontend-mentor-nft-preview-card-component
Solution to the Frontend Mentor NFT preview card component challenge using CSS flexbox.

This was the first challenge I attempted back when I first started learning web development a few months ago. I uploaded this to allow comparison between my first project and my more recent ones.

The layout was created using CSS flexbox to center the card on the page.
